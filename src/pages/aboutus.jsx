            The SKIT Alumni Association (SKITAA) was formally established in the
            year 2016, owing to the painstaking efforts and initiative of our
            beloved Principal Dr. Mahesha K. A seed committee was formed where
            Prof. Sreenivasan A. became the first Secretary of SKITAA. The
            committee held a membership drive and the first ever alumni meet was
            organized in the year 2016.
